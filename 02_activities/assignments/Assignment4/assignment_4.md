# Data Visualization

## Assignment 4: Final Project

### Requirements:
- We will finish this class by giving you the chance to use what you have learned in a practical context, by creating data visualizations from raw data. 
- Choose a dataset of interest from the [City of Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/) or [Ontarioâ€™s Open Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/). 
- Using Python and one other data visualization software (Excel or free alternative, Tableau Public, any other tool you prefer), create two distinct visualizations from your dataset of choice.  
- For each visualization, describe and justify: 
    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?

     data visualization 1 : Python
     data visualization 2 : Excel

    > Who is your intended audience? 

    City of Toronto Parks, Forestry & Recreation officials, government agenices responsible for enhancing and maintaining public amenities, city planners and general public. 

    
    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
      The visualization conveys the current status of washroom facilities, highlighting the number of portable and washroom buildings available along with their statuses(Open, Closed or need service) across Toronto. This information emphasizes the importance of thoroughly studying the locations that require immediate attention as well as making improvements in public restoom accessibility and management. Further data study is possible with this dataset.

    > What design principles (substantive, perceptual, aesthetic) did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply these principles? With what elements of your plots? 
      Substantative :I focused on key metrics that clearly show the status of washroom facilities and the count for each washroom type.
      Perceptual : I used different colors to make it easy to read and undderstand.
      Aesthetic : I tried to keep the layout simple and labelled the axeses for better clarity.

    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 
      The use of Python ensures reproducibility because the code can be run multiple times with the same dataset, generating consistent results. In Excel, the charts can be easily updated by refreshing the data or altering input ranges. If a tool is non-reproducible, it could hinder the ability to validate or update visualizations over time, causing potential discrepancies in the presented information.

    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
      I made the visualizations accessible by using clear labels and contrasting colors that accommodate color vision deficiencies.  In Python, I ensured proper font size and type for readability. 
      In Excel, I used descriptive titles and distinct colors for easy differentiation on what is presented.

    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  
      The primary individuals affected include local residents, city planners, and park management staff who need to assess and plan public restroom facilities.

    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 
      I focused on essential features directly related to the status of washroom facilitiesâ€” the Type and Status columns and excluded less critical data (like Comments, reasons etc) to streamline the visualizations. The goal was to present clear metrics that aid in understanding patterns in restroom availability. There is more potential to obtain useful information from the dataset that can add value to the present findings like which location needs immediate attention or maintenance, which area has least washrtoom facilities etc.

    > What â€˜underwater labourâ€™ contributed to your final data visualization product?
      The â€˜underwater labourâ€™ involved data preprocessing and cleaning steps in Python. There were missing values in the dataset but after analyzing the importance of those features I decided to keep them as there were not critical to the visualization. 
      In Excel, I experiemneted with multiple options for formating that helped refine the final plots for visualization.

- This assignment is intentionally open-ended - you are free to create static or dynamic data visualizations, maps, or whatever form of data visualization you think best communicates your information to your audience of choice! 
- Total word count should not exceed **(as a maximum) 1000 words** 
 
### Why am I doing this assignment?:  
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes: 
* Create and customize data visualizations from start to finish in Python
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story  
- This would be a great project to include in your GitHub Portfolio â€“ put in the effort to make it something worthy of showing prospective employers!
