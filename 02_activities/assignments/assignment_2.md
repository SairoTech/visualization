# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
        ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Your answer...
      ```
   **Good Visualization** :

    Climate Change: Global Land Surface Temperature Anomalies :  https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/arpita.pal/viz/ClimateChangeGlobalLandSurfaceTemperatureAnomalies/Globallandtemp 

    The visualization "Climate Change: Global Land Surface Temperature Anomalies" effectively communicates important information about global temperature changes over time.

   Reasons :
        1. The context of the data is clear, with well-labelled axes, including units, and a title that provides detailed information.
        2. The chart effectively displays temperature changes over time through an interactive line graph. When hovering over specific data points, it shows the exact temperatures for each year.
        3. The red and orange color gradient visually represents the increase in temperature, effectively conveying the intensity of the temperature rise over time. 
    To improve :
        1. Could have used a better color scheme to indicate spikes because it is hard to differentiate the light and dark blue color in a quick glance. Same with orange and red.

    **Bad Visualization** :
    
    College Football Fan Map : 

    America's Favorite College Football Teams, Determine by nukmber of Twitter followers :  https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/matt.sorenson/viz/CollegeFootballFollowerMap/CollegeFootballMap

    The College Football Fan Map, featured on Tableau, aims to represent the popularity of college football teams based on the number of Twitter followers. However, despite its intention to convey interesting data, the visualization presents multiple issues that undermine its clarity and effectiveness.

    Reasons :
        1. Overcrowded Design : The map is complex as it is overcrowded with execssive details. Large amount of data is overwhelming making it difficult to focus. The inclusion of team logos alongside the map's geographical markers makes it visually crowded and distracts from the overall message.
        2. Confusing Color Choices :The map's colors are not clearly distinguishable and creates confusion about what each color indicates.
        3. Lack of Proper Labeling, context and descriptive title: The absence of a descriptive title and labels that properly convey what the map represents is a significant issue. The current title is vague and does not clearly communicate the purpose of the map.
        4. There are no clear labels for the axes or the data points on the map.

    Suggestions for improvement :
        1. Simplify the map by reducing the number of unnecessary data points displayed or grouping teams regionally, the visualization would become more manageable and easier to digest.
        2. Use clearer, more distinct colors and provide a legend to explain their meaning.This would help differentiate teams and make the map easier to read. Adding a legend would help viewers quickly understand what the colors represent.
        3. Add a descriptive title and contextual information to ensure the audience understands the key message. A more detailed and informative title would explain the mapâ€™s purpose, and labeling key areas like the teamsâ€™ Twitter follower counts would provide clarity




  






      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
